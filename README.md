## Update Log

06.22.2025
- Dynamic Content Management:
  - The Home and Gallery pages now dynamically load images from the filesystem, with the Home page automatically showing the newest images first.
  - The Gallery uses folder names as collections and parses image metadata (date, camera settings) directly from filenames, eliminating the need for a backend.

- Responsive Redesign:
  - Implemented a site-wide responsive design for a consistent and user-friendly experience on all devices, from mobile to desktop.
  - Added a responsive navbar with a hamburger menu for streamlined mobile navigation.
  - All pages (Home, Gallery, About, Contact, Shop) now adapt their layouts for optimal viewing on any screen size.

- Enhanced User Experience:
  - Added interactive image modals to the Home and Gallery pages, featuring keyboard (arrow keys, ESC) and on-screen navigation.
  - The Gallery page now includes a filterable sidebar to sort images by collection. The sidebar is sticky on desktop for easy access and collapses into a dropdown menu on mobile.
  - Numerous UI and UX improvements were made, including adjustments to button positioning, font sizes, colors, and layout spacing for improved usability and aesthetics.
